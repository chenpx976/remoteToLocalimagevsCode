## TODO

This project is in very early stages. I currently see the following upgrades:
- Ability to replace single images
- Ability to replace for a entier file
- Settings for default path, prefix and more
- Dialog for selecting wanted save path
- Settings for chaning dowloaded image name
  - original file name with index?
  - Formated timestamps

## Features

Replace remote images in workspace with "Replace remote images " command

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.
